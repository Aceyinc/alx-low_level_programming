No more than 5 functions per file
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
Donâ€™t forget to push your header file

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
